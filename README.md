Communication by means of modulated Johnson noise.  
**Significance**  
This paper presents experimental realization of an ultralow power wireless communication method that works by selectively connecting or disconnecting an impedance-matched resistor and an antenna. This modulates microwave frequency Johnson noise emitted by the antenna. The data transmission hardware is similar to that of an RFID tag, which communicates by reflecting RF signals; the crucial advantage of the present system is that it requires no preexisting RF signal. An interesting feature of the system is that all components of the system are at the same physical temperature, but it functions because they have different noise temperatures. It is also notable that the elimination of the RF carrier simplifies the system architecture and the reader hardware.  
**Abstract**  
We present the design of a passive wireless communication method that does not rely on ambient or generated RF sources. Instead, the method modulates the Johnson (thermal) noise of a resistor to transmit information bits wirelessly. By selectively connecting or disconnecting a matched resistor to an antenna, the system can achieve data rates of up to 26 bps and distances of up to 7.3 m. This communication method operates at very low power, similar to that of an RFID tag, with the advantage of not requiring a preexisting RF signal to reflect.

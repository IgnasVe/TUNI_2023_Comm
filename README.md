1. first one associated with the use of the implantable chemical sources. It is the optimal solution, but it can be implemented only for the IMDs with low power consumption (100 uW) and in the cases when there is enough room for implants. It is the common solution for pacemakers and implantable defibrillators.   

2. second technique implies inductive powering. In this case continuous powering of the passive implant should be distinguished from the recharging of the implantable batteries.

First method is used for cochlear implants, second one is the common powering techniques for spinal cord stimulators.  

3. third for the mechanical circulatory systems the external rechargeable batteries are used which are connected to the implant via percutaneous cables.

Communication by means of modulated Johnson noise.  
**Significance**  
This paper presents experimental realization of an ultralow power wireless communication method that works by selectively connecting or disconnecting an impedance-matched resistor and an antenna. This modulates microwave frequency Johnson noise emitted by the antenna. The data transmission hardware is similar to that of an RFID tag, which communicates by reflecting RF signals; the crucial advantage of the present system is that it requires no preexisting RF signal. An interesting feature of the system is that all components of the system are at the same physical temperature, but it functions because they have different noise temperatures. It is also notable that the elimination of the RF carrier simplifies the system architecture and the reader hardware.  
**Abstract**  
We present the design of a passive wireless communication method that does not rely on ambient or generated RF sources. Instead, the method modulates the Johnson (thermal) noise of a resistor to transmit information bits wirelessly. By selectively connecting or disconnecting a matched resistor to an antenna, the system can achieve data rates of up to 26 bps and distances of up to 7.3 m. This communication method operates at very low power, similar to that of an RFID tag, with the advantage of not requiring a preexisting RF signal to reflect.

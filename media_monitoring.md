**Abstract**

In this news article introduced a new ultra-low-power method of communication. It is possible to wirelessly transmit information simply by opening and closing a switch that connects a resistor to an antenna. No need to send power to the antenna......


**Analysis**

Something

Something else
violate the second law of thermodynamics or not is not our concern here


limitations: However, our system has lower data rate and range than either backscatter radios or conventional radios.

what next: One area for future work is to improve our system's data rate and range, and to test it in applications such as implanted devices. For implanted devices, an advantage of our new method is that there is no need to expose the patient to a strong external radio signal, which can cause tissue heating. Even more exciting, we believe that related ideas could enable other new forms of communication in which other natural signal sources, such as thermal noise from biological tissue or other electronic components, can be modulated.

Finally, this work may lead to new connections between the study of heat (thermodynamics) and the study of communication (information theory). These fields are often viewed as analogous, but this work suggests some more literal connections between them.

### Communication by means of modulated Johnson noise.
**Significance**  
This paper presents experimental realization of an ultralow power wireless communication method that works by selectively connecting or disconnecting an impedance-matched resistor and an antenna. This modulates microwave frequency Johnson noise emitted by the antenna. The data transmission hardware is similar to that of an RFID tag, which communicates by reflecting RF signals; the crucial advantage of the present system is that it requires no preexisting RF signal. An interesting feature of the system is that all components of the system are at the same physical temperature, but it functions because they have different noise temperatures. It is also notable that the elimination of the RF carrier simplifies the system architecture and the reader hardware.  
**Abstract**  
We present the design of a passive wireless communication method that does not rely on ambient or generated RF sources. Instead, the method modulates the Johnson (thermal) noise of a resistor to transmit information bits wirelessly. By selectively connecting or disconnecting a matched resistor to an antenna, the system can achieve data rates of up to 26 bps and distances of up to 7.3 m. This communication method operates at very low power, similar to that of an RFID tag, with the advantage of not requiring a preexisting RF signal to reflect.

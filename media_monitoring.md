**Abstract**

This news article introduced a new ultra-low-power method of communication, it is possible to transmit information wirelessly, simply by opening and closing a switch that connects a resistor to an antenna. 

This system, combined with techniques for harvesting energy from the environment[1], could lead to all kinds of devices that transmit data without battery or other power sources. Apart from the energy needed to flip the switch, no other energy is needed and in this system the switch is a transistor, an electrically controlled switch with no moving parts consuming small amount of power. Powered signal source (like oscillator) is not needed, instead random thermal noise(Johnson noise) can take the palce of the signal driving the antenna[2].

**Analysis**

Article mentions about arguments between peer reviewer and research team that their method did violate the second law of thermodynamics or not, but our interest is communication not thermodynamics, so we skip this part, let's accpet that it did not break the law. In this ultra-low-power method, like other low-power communication systems, transmitter consumes barely amount of energy, on the other hand receiver consumes good amount of power, which (base station) has usually no problem with power supply. 


Advantages: **need to edit** an advantage of our new method is that there is no need to expose the patient to a strong external radio signal, which can cause tissue heating. Even more exciting, we believe that related ideas could enable other new forms of communication in which other natural signal sources, such as thermal noise from biological tissue or other electronic components, can be modulated  

usages:  **need to study** 
   - including tiny sensors and implanted medical devices,  
   - sensors for smart agriculture,  
   - electronics implanted in the body that never need battery changes,   
   - better contactless credit cards

**need to edit**
Current limitation: this system has lower data rate and lower range than either backscatter radios or conventional radios. 
Future: definitely improve system's data rate and range, and to test it in applications such as implanted devices. 

It highlights that this work may lead to new connection between thermodynamics and communication (information technoloty). These fields are often viewed as analogous, but this work suggests some more literal connections between them.
